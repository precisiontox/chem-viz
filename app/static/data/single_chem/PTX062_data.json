      "moa_drugbank": "Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that inhibits T cell activation.[A174049,A174088,A189411] Its binding to the receptor cyclophilin-1 inside cells produces a complex known as cyclosporine-cyclophilin. This complex subsequently inhibits calcineurin, which in turn stops the dephosphorylation as well as the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) that normally cause inflammatory reactions.  NF-AT is a transcription factor that promotes the production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha, all of which are involved in the inflammatory process. Specifically, the inhibition of IL-2, which is necessary for T cell activation or proliferation, is believed to be responsible for cyclosporine's  immunosuppressive actions.[A174049,A189408] In addition to the above, the inhibition of NF-AT leads to lower levels of other factors associated with T helper cell function and thymocyte development.[A174049]",
      "protein_binding": "About 50% of the administered dose is taken up by erythrocytes while about 34% is bound to lipoproteins.[A174088] Prescribing information for Sandimmune states that 90% is mainly bound to lipoproteins.[L3002]",
      "moa_t3db": "Cyclosporine binds to cyclophillin. The complex then inhibits calcineurin which is normally responsible for activating transcription of interleukin 2. Cyclosporine also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release. In ophthalmic applications, the precise mechanism of action is not known. Cyclosporine emulsion is thought to act as a partial immunomodulator in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca.",

      "moa_drugbank": "According to its FDA labeling, acetaminophen's exact mechanism of action has not been fully established[Label] - despite this, it is often categorized alongside NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) due to its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways.[T518] It is thought to exert central actions which ultimately lead to the alleviation of pain symptoms.[T518]\n\nOne theory is that acetaminophen increases the pain threshold by inhibiting two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, which are involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Prostaglandins are responsible for eliciting pain sensations.[A176366] Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly.[F4133] Studies also suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme that is unique from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2.[A468] This enzyme has been referred to as _COX-3_. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat.[F4133] The exact mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future research may contribute to deeper knowledge.[F4133]",
      "protein_binding": "The binding of acetaminophen to plasma proteins is low (ranging from 10% to 25%), when given at therapeutic doses.[Label]",
      "moa_t3db": "Acetaminophen is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works.",

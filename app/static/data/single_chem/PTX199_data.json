      "moa_drugbank": "The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]\n\nIbuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]",
      "protein_binding": "Ibuprofen dosage is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins and site II of purified albumin, binding appears to be saturable and becomes non-linear at concentrations exceeding 20 mcg/ml.[A39092]",
      "moa_t3db": "The exact mechanisms of action of Ibuprofen is unknown. Its antiinflammatory effects are believed to be due to inhibition of both cylooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which leads to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, and results in the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.",

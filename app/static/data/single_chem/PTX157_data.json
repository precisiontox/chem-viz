      "moa_drugbank": "Fluconazole is a very selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme _lanosterol 14-\u00ce\u00b1-demethylase_. This enzyme normally works to convert _lanosterol_ to _ergosterol_, which is necessary for fungal cell wall synthesis.  The free nitrogen atom located on the azole ring of fluconazole binds with a single iron atom located in the heme group of lanosterol 14-\u00ce\u00b1-demethylase.[A178774] This prevents oxygen activation and, as a result, inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol, halting the process of ergosterol biosynthesis.[A178777]  Methylated sterols are then found to accumulate in the fungal cellular membrane, leading to an arrest of fungal growth.[A178774] These accumulated sterols negatively affect the structure and function of the fungal cell plasma membrane.[A16632]\n\nFluconazole resistance may arise from an alteration in the amount or function of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-\u00ce\u00b1-demethylase), altered access to this enzyme, or a combination of the above.[A16632] Other mechanisms may also be implicated, and studies are ongoing.[A178783]",

      "moa_t3db": "Fluconazole interacts with 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Fluconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis.",

      "moa_drugbank": "Triamterene inhibits the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) located on the lumenal side in the late distal convoluted tubule and collecting tubule [A178042], which are transmembrane channels that normally promotes sodium uptake and potassium secretion.[A178048] In the late distal tubule to the collecting duct, sodium ions are actively reabsorbed via ENaC on the lumnial membrane and are extruded out of the cell into the peritubular medium by a sodium-potassium exchange pump, the Na-K-ATPase,[A178054] with water following passively.[T28] Triamterene exerts a diuretic effect on the distal renal tubule to inhibit the reabsorption of sodium ions in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions and its natriuretic activity is limited by the amount of sodium reaching its site of action.[L6169] Its action is antagonistic to that of adrenal mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, but it is not an inhibitor or antagonist of aldosterone.[L6166] Triamterene maintains or increases the sodium excretionm, thereby increasing the excretion of water, and reduces the excess loss of potassium, hydrogen and chloride ions by inhibiting the distal tubular exchange mechanism.[L6169] Due to its diuretic effect, triamterene rapidly and reversibly reduces the lumen-negative transepithelial potential difference by almost complete abolition of Na+ conductance without altering K+ conductance.[A177988] This reduces the driving force for potassium movement into the tubular lumen and thus decreases potassium excretion. [A178054] Triamterene is similar in action to [amiloride] but, unlike amiloride, increases the urinary excretion of magnesium.[A178039]",

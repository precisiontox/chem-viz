      "moa_drugbank": "A surface coating of benzophenones decreases the amount of UV radiation absorbed by the skin by limiting the total amount of energy that reaches the skin [L2663].\n\nBenzophenone sunscreens, applied topically, protect the skin from these harmful effects of ultraviolet light by chemically absorbing light energy (photons). As this occurs, the benzophenone molecule becomes activated to higher energy levels. As the excited molecule returns to its ground state, the energy is released in the form of thermal energy. The hydroxyl group in the ortho position to the carbonyl group is believed to be a structural requirement for the benzophenones' absorption of UV light. This structural arrangement also contributes to the electronic stability of the molecule.  Benzophenones absorb energy throughout the UV range, although the maximum  UV absorbance is between 284 and 287 nm for the 2-hydroxybenzophenones [L2669].",

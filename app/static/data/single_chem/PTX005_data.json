      "moa_t3db": "Arsenic disrupts ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. (T1); Arsenic binds to hemoglobin. (A15); Arsenic binds to haptoglobin. (A15); Arsenic binds to the estrogen receptor. (A17); Arsenic binds to the glucocorticoid receptor. (A17); Arsenic binds glutathione reductase, which results in the inhibition of essential biochemical reactions, alteration of cellular redox status, and eventual cytotoxicity. (L2); Arsenic binds to kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1. (A17); Arsenic binding of PARP-1 is believed to induce carcinogenesis by affecting DNA repair. (A17); Arsenic's carginogenicity is believed to be caused by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. (A17); Arsenic binds to actin. (A16); Arsenic binds thioredoxin reductase, which results in the inhibition of essential biochemical reactions, alteration of cellular redox status, and eventual cytotoxicity. (L2); Arsenic binding of XPA is believed to induce carcinogenesis by affecting DNA repair. (A17)",

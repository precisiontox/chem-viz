However, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inositol depletion theory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suggests 3 main potential targets[A176642]. These targets are inositol monophosphatase, inositol polyphosphatase, and glycogen synthase kinase 3(GSK-3)[A176642,L5843].\n\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inositol depletion theory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suggests lithium behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor of inositol monophosphatase in a manner inversely proportional to the degree of stimulus[A176642]. This inhibition lowers levels of inositol triphosphate[L5843]. However, stronger inhibitors of inositol monophosphatase are not as clinically effective and low levels of inositol triphosphate are associated with memory impairment[A176642,L5843].\n\nLithium acts on inositol polyphosphatase as an uncompetitive inhibitor[A176642]. This inhibition is thought to have multiple downstream effects that have yet to be clarified[A176642].\n\nLithium regulates phosphorylation of GSK-3 which regulates other enzymes through phosphorylation[A176642]. Lithium can also inhibit GSK-3 through interfering with the magnesium ion in the active site[A176642].",

      "moa_drugbank": "Although nadolol is described as a non selective beta blocker, it does not interact with beta 3 adrenal receptors.[A182402] Antagonism of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors in the heart inhibits cyclic AMP and its signalling pathway, decreasing the strength and speed of contractions as well as the speed of relaxation and conduction.[A34177] Antagonism of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the smooth muscle cells of the vasculature inhibits their relaxation, leading to an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and reducing the risk of severe hypotension.[A34177] The increase in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with nadolol use.[A182441] Antagonism of beta-1 adrenoceptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney inhibits the release of renin, and therefore angiotensin II mediated vasoconstriction, aldosterone mediated water retention, and the release of epinephrine.[A34177] Antagonism of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the liver and skeletal muscle inhibits glycogenolysis, in the lungs prevents bronchodilation, and in the pancrease inhibits insulin release.[A34177]",

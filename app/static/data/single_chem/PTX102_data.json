      "moa_drugbank": "The exact mechanism of action of colchicine has not been fully established, however likely occurs via the downstream inhibition of inflammation caused by tubulin disruption.[A183602] Studies have implied that that colchicine causes disruption of the inflammasome complex that is present in both monocytes and neutrophils, which normally leads to the activation of interleukin-1, an important mediator of inflammation.[A183605] In addition to the above actions, colchicine acts to interfere with pathways including neutrophil adhesion and recruitment, superoxide production, the RhoA/Rho effector kinase (ROCK) pathway, as well as a type of nuclear factor \u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u2019 (NF-\u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u2019) pathway, reducing inflammation.[A183611] \n\nOn a molecular level, colchicine can be described as an anti-mitotic drug, blocking the mitotic activity cells in the metaphase part of the cell cycle. Specifically, colchicine binds to tubulin, forming complexes that bind to microtubules. This stops their elongation. At low concentrations, colchicine stops microtubule growth and, at elevated concentrations, colchicine causes the depolymerization of microtubules.[A183602]",
      "protein_binding": "The plasma protein binding for colchicine is low to moderate, at 39 \u00c2\u00b1 5%, and it is mainly bound to albumin.[A183608,L8138]",

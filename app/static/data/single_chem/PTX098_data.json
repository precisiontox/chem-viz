      "moa_drugbank": "Methimazole's primary mechanism of action appears to be interference in an early step in thyroid hormone synthesis involving thyroid peroxidase (TPO), however the exact method through which methimazole inhibits this step is unclear.[A184559]  TPO, along with hydrogen peroxide, normally catalyzes the conversion of iodide to iodine and then further catalyzes the incorporation of this iodine onto the 3 and/or 5 positions of the phenol rings of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin. These thyroglobulin molecules then degrade within thyroid follicular cells to form either thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) or tri-iodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland.[A184697]\n\nMethimazole may directly inhibit TPO, but has been shown in vivo to instead act as a competitive substrate for TPO, thus becoming iodinated itself and interfering with the iodination of thyroglobulin.[A184559] Another proposed theory is that methimazole\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sulfur moiety may interact directly with the iron atom at the centre of TPO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heme molecule, thus inhibiting its ability to iodinate tyrosine residues.[A184694] Other proposed mechanisms with weaker evidence include methimazole binding directly to thyroglobulin or direct inhibition of thyroglobulin itself.[A184559]",

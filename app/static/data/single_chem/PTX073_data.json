(L4); Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. (A4); Causes endocrine disruption in humans by binding to and inhibiting the estrogen receptor. (A590); PCBs can cause endocrine disurption by binding to estrogen sulfotransferase, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. (A3, A66); PCB inhibition of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase is believed to cause decreased dopamine synthesis. (L4); PCBs will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A30)",

      "moa_drugbank": "Although phenytoin first appeared in the literature in 1946, it has taken decades for the mechanism of action to be more specifically elucidated.[A188826] Although several scientists were convinced that phenytoin altered sodium permeability, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until the 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that this phenomenon was linked to voltage-gated sodium channels.[A188826] \n\nPhenytoin is often described as a non-specific sodium channel blocker and targets almost all voltage-gated sodium channel subtypes.[A188826] More specifically, phenytoin prevents seizures by inhibiting the positive feedback loop that results in neuronal propagation of high frequency action potentials.[A188772,A189219,A189273]",

      "moa_t3db": "Phenytoin acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. By promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of post-tetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of post-tetanic potentiation prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas.",

      "moa_drugbank": "The 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase is a nuclear-bound steroid intracellular enzyme primarily located in the prostatic stromal cell that converts the androgen testosterone into the more active metabolite, 5\u00ce\u00b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[A2132] DHT is considered to be the primary androgen playing a role in the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.[A178270] DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone[T28] and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.[A178279] Responsible for the synthesis of approximately one-third of circulating DHT, type I 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase is predominant in the sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. The type II 5a-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver, and is responsible for two-thirds of circulating DHT.[L10568] Due to its dual inhibition of both isoenzymes of 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase, dutasteride causes a near-complete suppression of DHT.[A178348] Compared to a 70% reduction of serum DHT levels caused by [finasteride], a near-complete suppression of serum DHT-more than 90% is seen with dutasteride.[A178378]\n\nBy forming a stable complex with both type II and type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase, dutasteride inhibits its enzymatic action of converting testosterone to 5\u00ce\u00b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. It is proposed that DHT is the principal androgen responsible for prostatic growth in later life-normal masculinization of the external genitalia and maturation of the prostate gland during development-thus reducing the serum DHT levels results in reduced prostatic volume and increased epithelial apoptosis.[A178375] Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both Type I and Type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase isoenzymes and when evaluated under _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ conditions, the dissociation of the drug from the drug-enzyme complex is reported to be extremely slow.[L10568] Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.[L10568]",

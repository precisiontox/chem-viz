    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "The mechanism of action of caffeine is complex, as it impacts several body systems, which are listed below. The effects as they relate to various body systems are described as follows:\n\n**General and cellular actions**\n\nCaffeine exerts several actions on cells, but the clinical relevance is poorly understood. One probable mechanism is the inhibition of nucleotide phosphodiesterase enzymes, adenosine receptors, regulation of calcium handling in cells, and participates in adenosine receptor antagonism.[A187221,L9857] Phosphodiesterase enzymes regulate cell function via actions on second messengers cAMP and cGMP.[A187724] This causes lipolysis through activation of hormone-sensitive lipases, releasing fatty acids and glycerol.[T722]\n\n**Respiratory**\n\nThe exact mechanism of action of caffeine in treating apnea related to prematurity is unknown, however, there are several proposed mechanisms, including respiratory center stimulation in the central nervous system, a reduced threshold to hypercapnia with increased response, and increased consumption of oxygen, among others.[L9851] The blocking of the adenosine receptors enhances respiratory drive via an increase in brain medullary response to carbon dioxide, stimulating ventilation and respiratory drive, while increasing contractility of the diaphragm.[T716]\n\n**Central nervous system**\n\nCaffeine demonstrates antagonism of all 4 adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, A3) in the central nervous system.[T716,L9851] Caffeine's effects on alertness and combatting drowsiness are specifically related to the antagonism of the A2a receptor.[T716]\n\n**Renal system**\n\nCaffeine has diuretic effects due to is stimulatory effects on renal blood flow, increase in glomerular filtration, and increase in sodium excretion.[T716]\n\n**Cardiovascular system**\n\nAdenosine receptor antagonism at the A1 receptor by caffeine stimulates inotropic effects in the heart. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body.  In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation. It stimulates the endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall to release nitric oxide, potentiating blood vessel relaxation. Catecholamine release, however, antagonizes this and exerts inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. Finally, caffeine is shown to raise systolic blood pressure measurements by 5 to 10 mmHg when it is not taken regularly, versus no effect in those who consume it regularly.[T716] The vasoconstricting effects of caffeine are beneficial in migraines and other types of headache, which are normally caused by vasodilation in the brain.[A187709,L9872]",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "Plasma protein binding of caffeine has not been determined for neonates or infants. In vitro studies indicate a protein binding of about 10%-36%. Caffeine is reversibly bound to plasma proteins.[T722,L9851]",
    "Mechanism of Action (T3DB)": "Caffeine stimulates medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, promoting bradycardia, vasoconstriction, and increased respiratory rate. This action was previously believed to be due primarily to increased intracellular cyclic 3&prime;,5&prime;-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) following inhibition of phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that degrades cyclic AMP. It is now thought that xanthines such as caffeine act as agonists at adenosine-receptors within the plasma membrane of virtually every cell. As adenosine acts as an autocoid, inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic sites but augmenting the actions of norepinephrine or angiotensin, antagonism of adenosine receptors promotes neurotransmitter release. This explains the stimulatory effects of caffeine. Blockade of the adenosine A1 receptor in the heart leads to the accelerated, pronounced \"pounding\" of the heart upon caffeine intake.",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Sphingosine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd1\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdphosphate (S1P) is an important phospholipid that binds to various G\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdprotein\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdcoupled receptor subtypes, which can be identified as S1P1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5R. S1P and the receptors it binds to perform regular functions in the immune, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and nervous system.[A189321,A192744] S1P can be expressed ubiquitously, playing an important role in regulating inflammation.  S1P1R, S1P2R, and S1P3R receptors can be found in the cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous systems. S1P4R is found on lymphocytic and hematopoietic cells, while S1P5R expression is found only on the spleen (on natural killer cells) or in the central nervous system.[A189333]\n\nThe active form of the drug, fingolimod phosphate,  is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that exerts its mechanism of action in MS by binding to various sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (1, 3, 4, and 5). It suppresses the exit of lymphocytes from lymph nodes, leading to a lower level of lymphocytes circulating in peripheral circulation. This reduces the inflammation that is associated with MS. The mechanism of action of fingolimod is not fully understood,  but may be related to reduced lymphocyte circulation into the central nervous system.[A176474,L12651]\n\nImmune modulating treatment such as fingolimod is not typically employed for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Despite this, with the tissue findings of pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation, the timely use of immune modulators such as fingolimod can be considered to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19.

(A163); Chlorpyrifos oxon binds albumin and may generate an antibody response. (A164); Chlorpyrifos is an irreversible non-competitive inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 3A4. (A166); Chlorpyrifos inhibits neuropathy target esterase, producing ataxia. (A167); Chlorpyrifos oxon inhibits cannabinoid receptor 1. (A168); Chlorpyrifos inhibits an endogenous signaling modulator, fatty acid amide hydrolase, producing secondary neurotoxicity. (A217); This organochloride inhibits Na+/K+ ATPase and Ca2+ and Mg2+ ATPase, which are essential for the transport of calcium across membranes. This results in the accumulation of intracellular free calcium ions, which promotes release of neurotransmitters from storage vesicles, the subsequent depolarization of adjacent neurons, and the propagation of stimuli throughout the central nervous system. (T10); This organochloride antagonizes the action of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting at the GABA-A receptors, effectively blocking the GABA-induced uptake of chloride ions and causing hyperexcitability of the central nervous system.

In randomized clinical trials, genistein was seen to increase the ratio of nitric oxide to endothelin and improved flow-mediated endothelium dependent vasodilation in healthy postmenopausal women [A14417]. In addition, genistein may have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism by inhibiting islet tyrosine kinase activity as well as insulin release dependent on glucose and sulfonylurea [A14417].",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Nicotine is a stimulant drug that acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These are ionotropic receptors composed up of five homomeric or heteromeric subunits. In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the cortico-limbic pathways. This causes the channel to open and allow conductance of multiple cations including sodium, calcium, and potassium. This leads to depolarization, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels and allows more calcium to enter the axon terminal. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse. Dopamine binding to its receptors is responsible the euphoric and addictive properties of nicotine.\nNicotine also binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Binding opens the ion channel allowing influx of sodium, causing depolarization of the cell, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from intracellular vesicles into the bloodstream, which causes vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and increased blood sugar.",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action.\n\nValproate is known to inhibit succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.[A177991] This inhibition results in an increase in succinic semialdehyde which acts as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase ultimately reducing GABA metabolism and increasing GABAergic neurotransmission. As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.[A457] A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.\n\nIt has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK).[A457] These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.[A177997]\n\nValproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase.[A178000] This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.[A178003] Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-\u00ce\u00b1 and -\u00ce\u00b5 which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium.[A178015] The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.[A178018] Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.[A178021]\n\nValproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.[A457] Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.[A178024] Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.[A14708] Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. It is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.\n\nFinally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor.[A178030] Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated.[A178027] The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however H3 and H4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients.[A178033] Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.[A178036] H3 hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.[A11814]",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "Protein binding is linear at low concentrations with a free fraction of approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL but becomes non-linear at higher concentrations with a free fraction of 18.5% at 135 mcg/mL.[label] This may be due to binding at separate high and low-affinity sites on albumin proteins.[A178066] Binding is expected to decrease in the elderly and patients with hepatic dysfunction.",
    "Mechanism of Action (T3DB)": "Valproic Acid binds to and inhibits GABA transaminase. The drug's anticonvulsant activity may be related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, by inhibiting enzymes that catabolize GABA or block the reuptake of GABA into glia and nerve endings.

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G<sub>2</sub> which is the precursor to other PGs.[label,T116] These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac.\n\nPGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.\n\nPGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to \u00ce\u00b2 adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.\n\nPGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Tamoxifen competitively inhibits estrogen binding to its receptor, which is critical for it's activity in breast cancer cells.[A1025] Tamoxifen leads to a decrease in tumor growth factor \u00ce\u00b1 and insulin-like growth factor 1, and an increase in sex hormone binding globulin.[A1025] The increase in sex hormon binding globulin limits the amount of freely available estradiol.[A1025] These changes reduce levels of factors that stimulate tumor growth.[A1025]\n\nTamoxifen has also been shown to induce apoptosis in estrogen receptor positive cells.[A182195] This action is thought to be the result of inhibition of protein kinase C, which prevents DNA synthesis.[A182195] Alternate theories for the apoptotic effect of tamoxifen comes from the approximately 3 fold increase in intracellular and mitochondrial calcium ion levels after administration or the induction of tumor growth factor \u00ce\u00b2.[A182195]",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that inhibits T cell activation.[A174049,A174088,A189411] Its binding to the receptor cyclophilin-1 inside cells produces a complex known as cyclosporine-cyclophilin. This complex subsequently inhibits calcineurin, which in turn stops the dephosphorylation as well as the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) that normally cause inflammatory reactions.  NF-AT is a transcription factor that promotes the production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha, all of which are involved in the inflammatory process. Specifically, the inhibition of IL-2, which is necessary for T cell activation or proliferation, is believed to be responsible for cyclosporine's  immunosuppressive actions.[A174049,A189408] In addition to the above, the inhibition of NF-AT leads to lower levels of other factors associated with T helper cell function and thymocyte development.[A174049]",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "About 50% of the administered dose is taken up by erythrocytes while about 34% is bound to lipoproteins.[A174088] Prescribing information for Sandimmune states that 90% is mainly bound to lipoproteins.[L3002]",
    "Mechanism of Action (T3DB)": "Cyclosporine binds to cyclophillin. The complex then inhibits calcineurin which is normally responsible for activating transcription of interleukin 2. Cyclosporine also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release. In ophthalmic applications, the precise mechanism of action is not known. Cyclosporine emulsion is thought to act as a partial immunomodulator in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca.",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Tigecycline, a glycylcycline, inhibits protein translation in bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules into the A site of the ribosome. This prevents incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. Tigecycline carries a glycylamido moiety attached to the 9-position of minocycline. The substitution pattern is not present in any naturally occurring or semisynthetic tetracycline and imparts certain microbiologic properties to tigecycline. Tigecycline is not affected by the two major tetracycline resistance mechanisms, ribosomal protection and efflux. Accordingly, tigecycline has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. There has been no cross resistance observed between tigecycline and other antibiotics. Tigecycline is not affected by resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamases (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), target site modifications, macrolide efflux pumps or enzyme target changes (e.g. gyrase/topoisomerase). In vitro studies have not demonstrated antagonism between tigecycline and other commonly used antibacterial drugs. In general, tigecycline is considered bacteriostatic.",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "According to its FDA labeling, acetaminophen's exact mechanism of action has not been fully established[Label] - despite this, it is often categorized alongside NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) due to its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways.[T518] It is thought to exert central actions which ultimately lead to the alleviation of pain symptoms.[T518]\n\nOne theory is that acetaminophen increases the pain threshold by inhibiting two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, which are involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Prostaglandins are responsible for eliciting pain sensations.[A176366] Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly.[F4133] Studies also suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme that is unique from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2.[A468] This enzyme has been referred to as _COX-3_. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat.[F4133] The exact mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future research may contribute to deeper knowledge.[F4133]",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "The binding of acetaminophen to plasma proteins is low (ranging from 10% to 25%), when given at therapeutic doses.[Label]",
    "Mechanism of Action (T3DB)": "Acetaminophen is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works.",

    "Mechanism of Action (T3DB)": "Phenytoin acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. By promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of post-tetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of post-tetanic potentiation prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas.",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360] Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain.[A34360]\n\nWhile the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.[A4962] It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and \u00ce\u00b11-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine  D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of \u00ce\u00b1-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.[L2022]\n\nAntagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities. \n\nClinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans.[A4962] A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor.\n\nDue to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as [DB00734]. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs.  As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,[A4962] and therefore should only been used when necessary.",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "Studies have found that free fraction of haloperidol in human plasma is 7.5-11.6%. This was found to be comparable among healthy adults, young adults, elderly patients with schizophrenia, and even in patients with liver cirrhosis.[A32346]",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Carbamazepine's mechanism of action is not fully elucidated and is widely debated.[A180310,L7153] One major hypothesis is that carbamazepine inhibits sodium channel firing,  treating seizure activity. Animal research studies have demonstrated that carbamazepine exerts its effects by lowering polysynaptic nerve response and inhibiting post-tetanic potentiation. In both cats and rats, carbamazepine was shown to decrease pain caused by infraorbital nerve stimulation. A decrease in the action potential in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use. Carbamazepine causes the above effects by binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels and preventing action potentials, which normally lead to stimulatory effects on nerves.[A180403,T634] In bipolar disorder, carbamazepine is thought to increase dopamine turnover and increase GABA transmission, treating manic and depressive symptoms.[L7216]\n\nA common issue that has arisen is resistance to this drug in up to 30% of epileptic patients, which may occur to altered metabolism in patients with variant genotypes.[A180436] A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently been identified as the EPHX1 gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance to carbamazepine through methylation.[A180439]",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "Carbamazepine is 75%-80% bound to plasma proteins.[A180301,L1335] One pharmacokinetic study indicates that it is 72% bound to plasma proteins.[A180424]",
    "Mechanism of Action (T3DB)": "Carbamazepine inhibits sustained repetitive firing by blocking use-dependent sodium channels. Pain relief is believed to be associated with blockade of synaptic transmission in the trigeminal nucleus and seizure control with reduction of post-tetanic potentiation of synaptic transmission in the spinal cord. Carbamazepine also possesses anticholinergic, central antidiuretic, antiarrhythmic, muscle relaxant, antidepressant (possibly through blockade of norepinephrine release), sedative, and neuromuscular-blocking properties.",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Lidocaine is a local anesthetic of the amide type [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes [F4349, L5930, L5948]. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential [F4349, L5930, L5948]. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place [F4349, L5930, L5948].\n\nIn addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system [F4349, L5930, L5948]. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948].",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "The protein binding recorded for lidocaine is about 60 to 80% and is dependent upon the plasma concentration of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein [F4349, L5948]. Such percentage protein binding bestows lidocaine with a medium duration of action when placed in comparison to other local anesthetic agents [L5948].",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Methimazole's primary mechanism of action appears to be interference in an early step in thyroid hormone synthesis involving thyroid peroxidase (TPO), however the exact method through which methimazole inhibits this step is unclear.[A184559]  TPO, along with hydrogen peroxide, normally catalyzes the conversion of iodide to iodine and then further catalyzes the incorporation of this iodine onto the 3 and/or 5 positions of the phenol rings of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin. These thyroglobulin molecules then degrade within thyroid follicular cells to form either thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) or tri-iodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland.[A184697]\n\nMethimazole may directly inhibit TPO, but has been shown in vivo to instead act as a competitive substrate for TPO, thus becoming iodinated itself and interfering with the iodination of thyroglobulin.[A184559] Another proposed theory is that methimazole\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sulfur moiety may interact directly with the iron atom at the centre of TPO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heme molecule, thus inhibiting its ability to iodinate tyrosine residues.[A184694] Other proposed mechanisms with weaker evidence include methimazole binding directly to thyroglobulin or direct inhibition of thyroglobulin itself.[A184559]",

The entire replicase complex, including ribonucleotide reductase, is inactivated and DNA synthesis is selectively inhibited, producing cell death in S phase and synchronization of the fraction of cells that survive. Repair of DNA damaged by chemicals or irradiation is also inhibited by hydroxyurea, offering potential synergy between hydroxyurea and radiation or alkylating agents. Hydroxyurea also increases the level of fetal hemoglobin, leading to a reduction in the incidence of vasoocclusive crises in sickle cell anemia.

Specifically, colchicine binds to tubulin, forming complexes that bind to microtubules. This stops their elongation. At low concentrations, colchicine stops microtubule growth and, at elevated concentrations, colchicine causes the depolymerization of microtubules.[A183602]",

As a result of its binding its associated steroid hormone, progesterone, the progesterone receptor (PR) modulates the expression of genes that regulate the development, differentiation, and proliferation of target tissues [A175666]. In humans, PR is found to be highly expressed in the stromal (connective tissue) cells during the secretory phase and during pregnancy [A175651]. \n\nProgesterone may prevent pregnancy by changing the consistency of cervical mucus to be unfavorable for sperm penetration, and by inhibiting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which normally causes ovulation.  With perfect use, the first-year failure rate for progestin-only oral contraceptives is approximately 0.5%. The typical failure rate, however, is estimated to be approximately 5%, due to late or missed pills [F3904].",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Finasteride acts as a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase, a nuclear-bound steroid intracellular enzyme primarily located in the prostatic stromal cell that converts the androgen testosterone into the more active metabolite, 5\u00ce\u00b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[A2132] DHT is considered to be the primary androgen playing a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.[A178270] DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone[T28] and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.[A178279] Responsible for the production of DHT together with type I 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase, the type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver.[L6235] Although finasteride is 100-fold more selective for type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase than for the type I isoenzyme,[A178183] chronic treatment with this drug may have some effect on type I 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase, which is predominantly expressed in sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. It is proposed that the type I 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase and type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase is responsible for the production of one-third and two-thirds of circulating DHT, respectively. \n\nThe mechanism of action of Finasteride is based on its preferential inhibition of Type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase through the formation of a stable complex with the enzyme _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.[L10565] Finasteride works selectively, where it preferentially displays a 100-fold selectivity for the human Type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase over type I enzyme.[L6235] Inhibition of Type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations, minimal to moderate increase in serum testosterone concentrations, and substantial increases in prostatic testosterone concentrations. As DHT appears to be the principal androgen responsible for stimulation of prostatic growth, a decrease in DHT concentrations will result in a decrease in prostatic volume (approximately 20-30% after 6-24 months of continued therapy). It is suggested that increased levels of DHT can lead to potentiated transcription of prostaglandin D2, which promotes the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.[A178189] In men with androgenic alopecia, the mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but finasteride has shown to decrease scalp DHT concentration to the levels found in the hairy scalp, reduce serum DHT, increase hair regrowth, and slow hair loss. Another study suggests that finasteride may work to reduce bleeding of prostatic origin by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the prostate, leading to atrophy and programmed cell death.[A178183] This may bestow the drug therapeutic benefits in patients idiopathic prostatic bleeding, bleeding during anticoagulation, or bleeding after instrumentation.[A178183]",

This is converted to estriol by the placenta. If levels of \"unconjugated estriol\" are abnormally low in a pregnant woman, this may indicate a problem with the development of the child. The drug interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estriol upon the target cell.

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "The pharmacological effect of Metopirone is to reduce cortisol and corticosterone production by inhibiting the 11-&szlig;-hydroxylation reaction in the adrenal cortex. Removal of the strong inhibitory feedback mechanism exerted by cortisol results in an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. With continued blockade of the enzymatic steps leading to production of cortisol and corticosterone, there is a marked increase in adrenocortical secretion of their immediate precursors, 11-desoxycortisol and desoxycorticosterone, which are weak suppressors of ACTH release, and a corresponding elevation of these steroids in the plasma and of their metabolites in the urine. These metabolites are readily determined by measuring urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) or 17-ketogenic steroids (17-KGS). Because of these actions, metopirone is used as a diagnostic test, with urinary 17-OHCS measured as an index of pituitary ACTH responsiveness. Metopirone may also suppress biosynthesis of aldosterone, resulting in a mild natriuresis.",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Levothyroxine is a synthetically prepared levo-isomer of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>, a tetra-iodinated tyrosine derivative) that acts as a replacement in deficiency syndromes such as hypothyroidism. T<sub>4</sub> is the major hormone secreted from the thyroid gland and is chemically identical to the naturally secreted T<sub>4</sub>: it increases metabolic rate, decreases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and, in peripheral tissues, is converted to T<sub>3</sub>. Thyroxine is released from its precursor protein thyroglobulin through proteolysis and secreted into the blood where is it then peripherally deiodinated to form triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism. T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> have a relative potency of ~1:4. \n\nThyroid hormone increases the metabolic rate of cells of all tissues in the body. In the fetus and newborn, thyroid hormone is important for the growth and development of all tissues including bones and the brain. In adults, thyroid hormone helps to maintain brain function, food metabolism, and body temperature, among other effects. The symptoms of thyroid deficiency relieved by levothyroxine include slow speech, lack of energy, weight gain, hair loss, dry thick skin and unusual sensitivity to cold.\n\nThe thyroid hormones have been shown to exert both genomic and non-genomic effects.[A179950] They exert their genomic effects by diffusing into the cell nucleus and binding to thyroid hormone receptors in DNA regions called thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) near genes.[A179605] This complex of T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>, DNA, and other coregulatory proteins causes a conformational change and a resulting shift in transcriptional regulation of nearby genes, synthesis of messenger RNA, and cytoplasmic protein production.[A179605,A179935] For example, in cardiac tissues T<sub>3</sub> has been shown to regulate the genes for \u00ce\u00b1- and \u00ce\u00b2-myosin heavy chains, production of the sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins calcium-activated ATPase (Ca2+-ATPase) and phospholamban, \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic receptors, guanine-nucleotide regulatory proteins, and adenylyl cyclase types V and VI as well as several plasma-membrane ion transporters, such as Na+/K+\u00e2\u20ac\u201cATPase, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and voltage-gated potassium channels, including Kv1.5, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3. [A179938] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.\n\nThe non-genomic actions of the thyroid hormones have been shown to occur through binding to a plasma membrane receptor integrin aVb3 at the Arg-Gly-Asp recognition site.[A179959] From the cell-surface, T<sub>4</sub> binding to integrin results in down-stream effects including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ERK1/2) and causes subsequent effects on cellular/nuclear events including angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation.[A179935, A179956]",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA) and albumin (TBA). The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance and longer half-life of T4 compared to T3. Protein-bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone where only unbound hormone is metabolically active.[F4636]",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "The 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase is a nuclear-bound steroid intracellular enzyme primarily located in the prostatic stromal cell that converts the androgen testosterone into the more active metabolite, 5\u00ce\u00b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[A2132] DHT is considered to be the primary androgen playing a role in the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.[A178270] DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone[T28] and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.[A178279] Responsible for the synthesis of approximately one-third of circulating DHT, type I 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase is predominant in the sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. The type II 5a-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver, and is responsible for two-thirds of circulating DHT.[L10568] Due to its dual inhibition of both isoenzymes of 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase, dutasteride causes a near-complete suppression of DHT.[A178348] Compared to a 70% reduction of serum DHT levels caused by [finasteride], a near-complete suppression of serum DHT-more than 90% is seen with dutasteride.[A178378]\n\nBy forming a stable complex with both type II and type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase, dutasteride inhibits its enzymatic action of converting testosterone to 5\u00ce\u00b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. It is proposed that DHT is the principal androgen responsible for prostatic growth in later life-normal masculinization of the external genitalia and maturation of the prostate gland during development-thus reducing the serum DHT levels results in reduced prostatic volume and increased epithelial apoptosis.[A178375] Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both Type I and Type II 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase isoenzymes and when evaluated under _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ conditions, the dissociation of the drug from the drug-enzyme complex is reported to be extremely slow.[L10568] Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.[L10568]",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "Dutasteride is about 99% bound to albumin and 96.6% bound to \u00ce\u00b1-1 acid glycoprotein in the serum.[L10568]",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "**Mechanism of action on ovulation**\n\nOral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.[T659]\n\n**Mechanism of action in cervical mucus changes**\n\nSimilar to other levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives, the intrauterine (IUD) forms of levonorgestrel likely prevent pregnancy by increasing the thickness of cervical mucus, interfering with the movement and survival of sperm, and inducing changes in the endometrium, where a fertilized ovum is usually implanted.[L7778,L7781] Levonorgestrel is reported to alter the consistency of mucus in the cervix, which interferes with sperm migration into the uterus for fertilization. Levonorgestrel is not effective after implantation has occurred.[A181976] \nInterestingly, recent evidence has refuted the commonly believed notion that levonorgestrel changes the consistency of cervical mucus when it is taken over a short-term period, as in emergency contraception. Over a long-term period, however, levonorgestrel has been proven to thicken cervical mucus.[A181976] The exact mechanism of action of levonorgestrel is not completely understood and remains a topic of controversy and ongoing investigation.[A181976,L7760]\n\n*Effects on implantation**\n\nThe effects of levonorgestrel on endometrial receptivity are unclear, and the relevance of this mechanism to the therapeutic efficacy of levonorgestrel is contentious.[A175372,A218666] Prescribing information for levonorgestrel IUDs state that they exert local morphological changes to the endometrium (e.g. stromal pseudodecidualization, glandular atrophy) that may play a role in their contraceptive activity.[L7778,L7781]\n\n**Mechanism of action in hormone therapy**\n\nWhen combined with estrogens for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis, levonorgestrel serves to lower the carcinogenic risk of unopposed estrogen therapy via the inhibition of endometrial proliferation. Unregulated endometrial proliferation sometimes leads to endometrial cancer after estrogen use.[L7808]",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "The protein binding of levonorgestrel ranges from 97.5-99%, and it is mainly bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Levonorgestrel is also bound to albumin.[A10375,L7760,L7781,L7823] The prescribing information for the implanted levonorgestrel indicates that the concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is reduced in the span of a few days after levonorgestrel administration, decreasing the levels of the drug.[L7823]",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "The exact mechanism of action is unknown, however, droperidol causes a CNS depression at subcortical levels of the brain, midbrain, and brainstem reticular formation. It may antagonize the actions of glutamic acid within the extrapyramidal system. It may also inhibit cathecolamine receptors and the reuptake of neurotransmiters and has strong central antidopaminergic action and weak central anticholinergic action. It can also produce ganglionic blockade and reduced affective response. The main actions seem to stem from its potent Dopamine(2) receptor antagonism with minor antagonistic effects on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors as well.",

The free nitrogen atom located on the azole ring of fluconazole binds with a single iron atom located in the heme group of lanosterol 14-\u00ce\u00b1-demethylase.[A178774] This prevents oxygen activation and, as a result, inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol, halting the process of ergosterol biosynthesis.[A178777]  Methylated sterols are then found to accumulate in the fungal cellular membrane, leading to an arrest of fungal growth.[A178774] These accumulated sterols negatively affect the structure and function of the fungal cell plasma membrane.[A16632]\n\nFluconazole resistance may arise from an alteration in the amount or function of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-\u00ce\u00b1-demethylase), altered access to this enzyme, or a combination of the above.[A16632] Other mechanisms may also be implicated, and studies are ongoing.[A178783]",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump [A175180], expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid) [A174295].\n\nOmeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours [A175192].  This antisecretory effect is dose-related and leads to the inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion, regardless of the stimulus [FDA label].  \n\n**Mechanism of H. pylori eradication**\n\nPeptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with _Helicobacter pylori_ bacterial infection (NSAIDs) [A175195]. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen [FDA label], [A175198]. \n_H. pylori_ replicates most effectively at a neutral pH [A175213]. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori [A175198]. It is generally believed that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the _urease_ enzyme, which increases the pathogenesis of H. pylori in gastric-acid related conditions [A175216].",

[A178054] Triamterene is similar in action to [amiloride] but, unlike amiloride, increases the urinary excretion of magnesium.[A178039]",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a signaling pathway that works in synergism with the sympathetic system to regulate blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Activation of this system upon stimulation by different factors, such as low blood pressure and nerve impulses, leads to increased release of norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic nerve terminals and effects on the vascular growth, vasoconstriction, and salt retention in the kidneys.[T28] Renin is released from \nRenin acts on the precursor prottein angiotensinogen, which is a plasma globulin synthesized from the liver, to produce cleaved peptide hormone angiotensin I.[T28] Angiotensin I then can be further cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictive peptide hormone.[label] Present in different isoforms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is peptidyl dipeptidase enzyme expressed in various tissues, including the vascular tissues, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.[T28] ACE also plays a role in inactivation of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide.[T28,label] Angiotensin II mediates various actions on the body by working on its G-protein coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2.[T28] It causes direct vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules, inhibits the reuptake of NE thereby increasing available levels, stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, reduces urinary excretion of sodium ions and water by promoting proximal tubular reabsorption, stimulates synthesis and release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and stimulates hypertrophy of both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.[L6619]\n\nEnalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to form [enalaprilat], its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE.[label] Biotransformation is critial for the therapeutic actions of the drug, as enalapril itself is only a weak inhibitor of ACE.[A179131] ACE inhibition results in reduced production and plasma levels of angiotensin II, increased plasma renin activity due to the loss of feedback inhibition by angiotensin II, and decreased aldosterone secretion.[L6586] However, plasma aldosterone levels usually return to normal during long-term administration of enalapril.[A179140] Decreased levels of angiotensin II subsequently leads to the dilatation of peripheral vessles and reduced vascular resistance which in turn lower blood pressure.[A179140] While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension. It is suggested that enalapril may mediate its pharmacological actions via other modes of action that are not fully understood.[label] As ACE is structurally similar to kininase I, which is a carboxypeptidase that degrades bradykinin, whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.[label]",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "It is reported that less than 50% of enalaprilat is bound to human plasma proteins, based on limited data from binding studies of enalaprilat in human plasma both by equilibrium dialysis and by ultrafiltration.[A18459,A179140]",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Furosemide promotes diuresis by blocking tubular reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the proximal and distal tubules, as well as in the thick ascending loop of Henle. This diuretic effect is achieved through the competitive inhibition of sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporters (NKCC2) expressed along these tubules in the nephron, preventing the transport of sodium ions from the lumenal side into the basolateral side for reabsorption. This inhibition results in increased excretion of water along with sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, hydrogen, and potassium ions.[L7961] As with other loop diuretics, furosemide decreases the excretion of uric acid.[T28] \n\nFurosemide exerts direct vasodilatory effects, which results in its therapeutic effectiveness in the treatment of acute pulmonary edema. Vasodilation leads to reduced responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II and noradrenaline, and decreased production of endogenous natriuretic hormones with vasoconstricting properties. It also leads to increased production of prostaglandins with vasodilating properties. Furosemide may also open potassium channels in resistance arteries.[T28] The main mechanism of action of furosemide is independent of its inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone.[L7958]",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Once tenofovir is activated by a bi-phosphorylation it acts as an antiviral acyclic nucleoside phosphonate. It is a potent inhibitor of the viral reverse transcriptase with an inhibitory constant of approximately 0.022 micromolar.[A18473] \n\nOnce activated, tenofovir acts with different mechanisms including the inhibition of viral polymerase causing chain termination and the inhibition of viral synthesis.[L6241] All these activities are attained by its competition with deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate in the generation of new viral DNA. Once tenofovir is incorporated in the chain, it induces a chain termination which in order inhibits viral replication.[A178330] The safety of tenofovir relies on its low affinity towards the cellular DNA polymerase including the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma.[T324]",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "Bisphosphonates are taken into the bone where they bind to hydroxyapatite. Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis.[A959] Endocytic vesicles become acidified, releasing bisphosphonates into the cytosol of osteoclasts where they act.[A959]\n\nOsteoclasts mediate resorption of bone.[A6366] When osteoclasts bind to bone they form podosomes, ring structures of F-actin.[A6366] Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption.[A6366]\n\nNitrogen containing bisphosphonates such as pamidronate are known to induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells by inhibiting the components of the mevalonate pathway farnesyl diphosphate synthase, farnesyl diphosphate, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate.[A202769,A203123,A203111] These components are essential for post-translational prenylation of GTP-binding proteins like Rap1.[A202769,A203123] The lack of prenylation of these proteins interferes with their function, and in the case of Rap1, leads to apoptosis.[A202769,A203123] pamidronate also activated caspases 3 and 9 which further contribute to apoptosis.[A202769,A203123,A203177]",
    "Protein Binding (DrugBank)": "Pamidronate is approximately 54% protein bound in serum.[L13892]",
    "Mechanism of Action (T3DB)": "The mechanism of action of pamidronate is inhibition of bone resorption. Pamidronate adsorbs to calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) crystals in bone and may directly block dissolution of this mineral component of bone. In vitro studies also suggest that inhibition of osteoclast activity contributes to inhibition of bone resorption. Pamidronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "The exact mechanism(s) of action by which both (a) insects are repelled by diethyltoluamide (DEET), and (b) humans can be affected deleteriously by exposure to toxic amounts of DEET have not yet been formally elucidated [L2774, L2775, L2777].\n\nResearch is ongoing regarding the exact mechanism of action by which DEET is capable of repelling insects. However, the most longstanding mechanism proposes that the DEET chemical blocks the olfactory receptors of insects for the volatile 1-octen-3-ol compound that is an element in human sweat and breath [A33052]. As a consequence, this proposed mechanism suggests that the blockade of insects' senses for this 1-octen-3-ol blinds and prevents the triggering of their biting and/or feeding instinct on humans and other animals that produce that compound [A33052]. Nevertheless, this theory has not yet been fully elucidated.\n\nFurthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that DEET binds to certain molecular targets like the Anopheles gambiae odorant binding protein 1 (AgamOBP1) with high shape complementarity [A33053] and the antennae-specific odorant receptor CquiOR136 of the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus [L2778]. In southern house mosquitos with reduced CquiOR136 transcript levels, behavioral tests demonstrated that this phenotype showed demonstrably lower responses/repulsion to DEET [L2778]. Again, however, such findings require continued research and do not formally elucidate the mechanism of action by which DEET can repel insects.\n\nAnd finally, the mechanism of toxicity in which DEET is capable of eliciting effects of neurotoxicity in humans who have been exposed to toxic levels of the agent is also poorly understood [L2775, A33054]. A recent study proposes that DEET is capable of blocking Na+ and K+ channels in the rat animal model [A33054]. This ion channel blocking activity of DEET in neurons may subsequently contribute to the kind of neuro-sensory adverse effects like numbness experienced after inadvertent application to the lips or mouth of humans [A33054].",

    "Mechanism of Action (DrugBank)": "A surface coating of benzophenones decreases the amount of UV radiation absorbed by the skin by limiting the total amount of energy that reaches the skin [L2663].\n\nBenzophenone sunscreens, applied topically, protect the skin from these harmful effects of ultraviolet light by chemically absorbing light energy (photons). As this occurs, the benzophenone molecule becomes activated to higher energy levels. As the excited molecule returns to its ground state, the energy is released in the form of thermal energy. The hydroxyl group in the ortho position to the carbonyl group is believed to be a structural requirement for the benzophenones' absorption of UV light. This structural arrangement also contributes to the electronic stability of the molecule.  Benzophenones absorb energy throughout the UV range, although the maximum  UV absorbance is between 284 and 287 nm for the 2-hydroxybenzophenones [L2669].",

    "Mechanism of Action (T3DB)": "Chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins cause their toxic effects by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and subsequently altering the trascription of certain genes. The affinity for the Ah receptor depends on the structure of the specific CDD. The change in gene expression may result from the direct interaction of the Ah receptor and its heterodimer-forming partner, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, with gene regulatory elements or the initiation of a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade that subsequently activates other transcription factors. The affected genes include several oncogenes, growth factors, receptors, hormones, and drug-metabolizing enzymes. The change in transcription/translation of these genes is believed to be the cause of most of the toxic effects of CDDs. This includes 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin's carcinogenicity is thought to be the result of its ability to alter the capacity of both exogenous and endogenous substances to damage the DNA by inducing CYP1A1- and CYP1A2-dependent drug-metabolizing enzymes.

(A94); Pentachlorophenol causes adverse effects on thyroid homeostasis, decreasing serum thyroxine by competing for serum protein thyroxine binding sites. (L127); This organochloride inhibits Na+/K+ ATPase and Ca2+ and Mg2+ ATPase, which are essential for the transport of calcium across membranes. This results in the accumulation of intracellular free calcium ions, which promotes release of neurotransmitters from storage vesicles, the subsequent depolarization of adjacent neurons, and the propagation of stimuli throughout the central nervous system. (T10); Pentachlorophenol inhibits mitochondrial ATP-ase activity, preventing the the formation of ATP and the release of energy to the cell from the breakdown of ATP to ADP. (A95); This organochloride antagonizes the action of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting at the GABA-A receptors, effectively blocking the GABA-induced uptake of chloride ions and causing hyperexcitability of the central nervous system.
